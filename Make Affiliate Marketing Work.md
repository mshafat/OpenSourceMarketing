So many people join affiliate marketing business every single day...
And almost none of them can stay with it more than a year...
Of those who does, majority struggle for years...
I wasn't an exception...
In fact, I also struggled for years...
But deep in my heart I always found a hope...
I found the proof that it is possible to make money with affiliate marketing...
Cause I made a lot of sales to prove it...
But it wasn't still working...
Because I started affiliate marketing with a reason...
I wanted to make a lot of money...
A lot of money to build a fund here in my country...
I made a portion of it already but that was not enough...
That wasn't consistent..
If I can't make a consistent high income from affiliate marketing how can I say it is working?
How can I achieve my cause for starting it?
So I kept searching...
I kept searching for a solution...
Although I struggled for years...
I have seen a pattern...
Vendors are making sales...
Through affiliates and also by themselves
But affiliates are struggling...
My question was how a vendor can sell his own product when an affiliate can't
Because vendor is making sell himself proves that the product has customers
It also proves that you can sell it too
But why can't an affiliate fail to promote the same product
Is it because he gets 50% of the commission?
I always looked for answers...
And in my quest of searching for the right answer I found a direction...
