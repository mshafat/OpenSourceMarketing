So many people join affiliate marketing business each day...
And almost none of them can stay with it more than a year...
Of those who does, majority struggle for years...
I wasn't an exception...
In fact, I also struggled for years...
But deep in my heart I always found a hope...
I found the proof that it is possible to make money with affiliate marketing...
Cause I made a lot of sales to prove it...
But it wasn't still working...
Because I started affiliate marketing with a reason...
I wanted to make a lot of money...
A lot of money to build a fund here in my country...
I made a portion of it already but that was not enough...
That wasn't consistent..
If I can't make a consistent high income from affiliate marketing how can I say it is working?
How can I achieve my cause for starting it?
So I kept searching...
I kept searching for a solution...
Although I struggled for years...
I have seen a pattern...
Vendors are making sales...
Through affiliates and also by themselves
But affiliates are struggling...
