So many people join affiliate marketing business every single day...
And almost none of them can stay with it more than a year...
Of those who does, majority struggle for years...
I wasn't an exception...
In fact, I also struggled for years...
But deep in my heart I always found a hope...
I found the proof that it is possible to make money with affiliate marketing...
Cause I made a lot of sales to prove it...
But it wasn't still working...
Because I started affiliate marketing with a reason...
I wanted to make a lot of money...
A lot of money to build a fund here in my country...
I made a portion of it already but that was not enough...
That wasn't consistent..
If I can't make a consistent high income from affiliate marketing how can I say it is working?
How can I achieve my cause for starting it?
So I kept searching...
I kept searching for a solution...
Although I struggled for years...
I have seen a pattern...
Vendors are making sales...
Through affiliates and also by themselves
But affiliates are struggling...
My question was how a vendor can sell his own product when an affiliate can't
Because vendor is making sell himself proves that the product has customers
It also proves that you can sell it too
But why can't an affiliate fail to promote the same product
Is it because he gets 50% of the commission?
I always looked for answers...
And in my quest of searching for the right answer I found a direction...
One of the reason I found was that
Vendor made the product himself and has complete belief on the product...
On the other hand affiliates may have belief on the vendor's product but not as much as the vendor...
To make sale, one need to have "conviction"
Conviction that it is a truely helpful product for my audience...
I also searched for reasons why affiliates fail...
There are a lot of mental shift an affiliate needs to go through...
Like changing a mindset from a continuous consumer to a constant producer of contents...
There's no alternative to this trait...
It should be achieved at any cost...
Another important shift needed is a shift from working on producer side to consumers side...
Because ultimately an affiliate must be resonate with his audience...
And I know it is not easy to change this mindset...
Sometimes people know these...that they should be producing more contents and work with generating and nurturing leads...
But the problem is they find it overwhelming
I have thought about this problem...
And found it everything feels overwhelming until you manage it...
And to manage it you need to have some skill if you don't have already...
In affiliate marketing 2 skills are crucial -- content creation and copywriting
For content creation you need to generate content ideas, scripts and know how to deliver it using texts, visuals and videography
And copywriting skill is needed to make your contents stand out from the crowd and get those contents a medium of your lead generation and sales. 
Now there's another problem...
It requires time to get these skills...
But there are all shorts of shiny objects that promises something else...
They can't focus on what's necessary 
But they move on to the hottest trends...
May be it is a new traffic source
May be it is a new software or biz opp
Or may be it is a new digital marketing course...
They can't focus...
Therefore they need a system that keeps them focus...
Ultimately skills pay the bills
And the 2 skills that I mentioned are invaluable for affiliate marketers of all sorts...
