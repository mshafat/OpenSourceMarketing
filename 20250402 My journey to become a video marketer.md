It all started in April 1, 2025 when I created an Youtube channel named DigiShikhon. I created the channel, made a logo and banner using canva. Not the best one but fortunately I got a premium canva a week ago. So it helped. My goal is to use what I already have got to empower more bangladesh youth with digital learning. For example I have got a lavaliere microphone which I rarely used. I have got Postuby and Canva pro for thumbnails and graphic works. I have got core i5 capable thinkpad to record and edit screen and publish my work. I have got plenty of digital skill to teach more people who haven't got those skills yet. I have got 12 week year framework and need to apply that too...there are many things I have got but hardly used. So it is time to use those things, build something and share with the world what I have got...

We are in the age of AI and I know it is such a blessing. But I got this hunch that most of those who have used AI are not using it properly. I was not an exception. But I want to change it. For example, I have used AI to come up with the name of the channel DigiShikhon yesterday. Today I also used it to get a roadmap to learn 80% of video editing in next 3 days. First it gave me a 7 day module with some really good stuff to learn each day. But I wanted to use 80/20 principles as it is something I learned and I want to use. So it told it to remove all the fluff and give me a gist of things to learn to make a moderately good video, with some animations, good audio in next 3 days using kdenlive. And got a very good module. Hope it will help me become a good video editors within next week.
