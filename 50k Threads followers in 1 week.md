Hi, this is Shafat M. I am the owner of the thread handle ==@allthrusmartphone.== I am an ethical marketer, which means I can't promote everything that I come across just because it can make me money. I always think about my audience first. My mission for AllThruSmartphone is to help people learn, build, and run a business entirely through their smartphones. Threads is a new social media platform that can be used completely from a smartphone. I see that many people want to grow their Threads handles.Today, I discovered a Threads profile that has experienced significant growth in the past week. I took the time to analyze this profile and shared my findings with my audience. If you liked this document, please share the link.

While going through his recommended software I learned the following:

> 80% of Threads followers come from valuable comments to others posts.

So the posts are there to model and follow, but don't stop yourself from commenting on other people's post. Always share value so that people wants to visit your profile and give a follow. 

Thanks for reading the doc so far.
